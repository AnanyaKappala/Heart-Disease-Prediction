# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Minor project on Heart Disease Prediction on machine learning as Minor project in college.

Heart Disease Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to create an accurate heart disease prediction model using machine learning, specifically emphasizing the Random Forest classifier. The objective is to efficiently identify the presence or absence of heart disease using patient data, enabling early detection and intervention. By conducting thorough data analysis, model training, and evaluation, this project strives to deliver a valuable asset for healthcare providers, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and mitigating the impact of heart disease.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing:

Identified and normalized continuous variables.
Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized feature distributions.
Explored correlations between features and the target variable.
Developed a correlation matrix plot to depict feature relationships.
Machine Learning Models:

Trained three classifiers: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Tree.
Employed metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation.
The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy, suggesting its potential for clinical applicability.
Visualization:

Created various plots to provide visual insights into data and model performance.
Developed an age vs. max heart rate graph to explore cardiovascular dynamics.
Results
The Random Forest Classifier emerged as the top-performing model, achieving 100% accuracy on the training set and 84.87% accuracy on the testing set. This indicates that machine learning models can effectively predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on the provided features.
